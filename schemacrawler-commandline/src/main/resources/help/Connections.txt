--- Connection Options ---

For connecting to specific databases, use

-server=<database system identifier>
  Where <database system identifier> is a database where
  a SchemaCrawler plugin is available.   
  For help on server specific connection options, 
  re-run SchemaCrawler with:
  -help -server=<database system identifier>

On the other hand, if your database does not have a 
SchemaCrawler plugin, use

-url=<url>
  JDBC connection URL to the database.

Then, provide a username and password

-u=<user> (short for -user=<user>)
  Database user name.

-password=<password>
  Database password.

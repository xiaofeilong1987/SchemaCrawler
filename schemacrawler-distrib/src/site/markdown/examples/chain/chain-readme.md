## Description
SchemaCrawler allows scripting with database metadata, using JavaScript. This
example shows how to "chain" or run multiple SchemaCrawler commands.

## How to Run

2. Start the test database server by running the StartDatabaseServer script from the distribution directory 
3. Start a command shell in the chain example directory 
4. Run `chain.cmd chain.js`  (or `chain.sh chain.js` on Unix) 

## How to Experiment
1. Try modifying the JavaScript in the `chain.js` file to run different SchemaCrawler commands.
